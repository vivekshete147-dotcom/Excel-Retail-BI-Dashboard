# Excel-Retail-BI-Dashboard

---

## 📝 Problem Statement
Retail companies generate thousands of transactions daily across multiple products, customers, and regions.  
However, raw data in CSV format is often **scattered, inconsistent, and difficult to analyze directly**.  
Without proper data cleaning, modeling, and reporting, it becomes challenging to answer key business questions such as:


This project was created to **transform raw retail data into an interactive Excel dashboard** that enables business leaders to track KPIs and gain actionable insights.

## 🎯 Tasks 

You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following task. You can download all relevant documents from the download section.

- How does revenue vary across sales channels and product categories?

- Which states generate the highest revenue, and how do they compare regionally?

- What is the monthly revenue trend, and are there any noticeable seasonal patterns?

- Which customer segments (loyalty tier, region, age group) contribute most to revenue?

# Important Insights from the Dashboard 

1. Revenue concentration: Top 10 products contribute ~40–45% of total revenue, showing high dependency on a few SKUs.

2. Profitability variation: Some categories (e.g., Electronics) generate high revenue but lower profit margins due to high discounts and shipping costs.

3. Discount impact: Orders with >15% discount show a 20–25% lower profit margin, indicating over-discounting risk.

4. Seasonality: Monthly trends reveal peak orders around festive/holiday periods, with spikes in November–December.

5. Average Order Value (AOV): Average order value is ₹3,200, but varies significantly by region and loyalty tier.

6. Return Rate: West region shows the highest return rate (~7–8%), pointing to potential supply chain or customer experience issues.

7. Loyalty tiers: Platinum customers generate ~2x higher revenue per order compared to Silver-tier customers.

8. Customer demographics: Younger customers (<30 years) are more price-sensitive, purchasing more frequently with higher discounts applied.

9. Category mix: Beauty and Clothing categories deliver higher profit margins despite lower revenue, compared to Electronics.

10. Regional performance: North and South regions together drive ~60% of revenue, but West lags despite a large customer base.

11. Shipping fees: Orders with free/low-cost shipping show 15% higher retention, highlighting logistics as a competitive advantage.

12. Profit drivers: Bundled orders (multi-product) yield higher AOV and lower return rates compared to single-product purchases.

# Learned things from the project

- I applied Power Query to clean, transform, and merge raw retail data, ensuring it was ready for analysis.

- I built a relational Data Model connecting Sales, Products, and Customers, and created DAX measures such as Revenue, Profit, AOV, and Return Rate.

- I designed an interactive Excel dashboard using PivotTables, PivotCharts, Slicers, and Timelines to make insights easy to explore.

- I handled missing values and data quality issues, applying cleaning techniques before building insights.

- I uncovered key business insights, including revenue concentration in top products, the negative impact of discounts on margins, and higher return rates in certain regions.

- I documented the entire project with a data dictionary and GitHub repository, showcasing my end-to-end analytical, technical, and presentation skills.
